In 2023, bike sales varied each month. May had the highest sales with 53 bikes sold. February, April, August, September, October, and November had the lowest sales, each with 39 bikes sold.

Our customers were almost equally divided between men (250) and women (249). Most of our customers were married (427), while only 62 were unmarried. This shows that married people are more likely to buy bikes.

Kansas City and Oakland had the most customers, making them our best markets. Anaheim had the fewest customers, showing less interest in bikes there.

We expect bike sales to stay stable in the coming months. This stability allows us to plan for maintaining and growing our market share.

To sum up, May was our best sales month in 2023, while several other months had lower sales. Our customer base is evenly split between men and women, with more married customers. Kansas City and Oakland are strong markets, while Anaheim needs more attention.

We recommend increasing promotions in Kansas City and Oakland, working to boost sales in Anaheim, and targeting married customers with specific campaigns. Regularly checking sales trends and customer feedback will help us adjust our strategies and keep sales steady.
